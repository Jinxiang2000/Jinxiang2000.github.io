Hello! I'm Jinxiang, a data-driven and detail-oriented Industrial and Operations Engineering Graduate student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am interested in data science, statistical learning, optimization, and operation management. I am passionate about using data to uncover insights that drive strategic decisions and create meaningful impact. 

With a robust academic background from the University of California, Santa Barbara, I graduated with a dual degree in Statistics and Data Science and Mathematics, where I honed my skills in advanced statistical techniques and mathematical problem-solving.

## Professional Experience

My professional journey includes impactful roles such as an **Engineering Design Trainee** at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, where I optimized budget allocations for critical infrastructure projects and spearheaded the development of a Staff Deliverability Forecasting tool. 

My expertise was further expanded during my time as a **Data Analyst** at GoGaucho, where I enhanced a mobile application serving over 10,000 monthly users. Additionally, as a **Student Assistant** at UCSB's DREAM Lab, I supported multiple research projects through meticulous data preparation and analysis.

## Research & Development

In research, I've embraced challenges that range from developing big data analytics tools at SOCR Lab to sentiment analysis in social media at UCSB's Social Perception Lab. My projects often involve sophisticated data manipulation and predictive modeling, utilizing a variety of programming languages and tools such as Python, R, Matlab, and more.

## Thank You

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. I hope you enjoy exploring my past projects and learning more about my experience and skills. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to connect.

Best Regards,  
**Jinxiang Ma**
